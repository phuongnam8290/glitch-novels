(1, 'Good', '<p>This novel is one of the peaks of korean writing. Its short, action packed, has great characters, mystery and lots of fans service. I enjoyed every second of it and i am glad that i waited for it to finish, befor i started reading. Because waiting for chapters after starting reading was no option. Can only recommend this story.</p>', 5.0, 0, 4, 3),
(3, 'Great plot development', '</p>This novel is definitely in the top 10 of my novels. He has a great plot development and it''s easy to see that when comparing how the protagonist was in the past and how he is now, in addition the development of the other characters was also great (only a few that left something to be desired, but it''s not something that interfere with reading). Well, I really liked this novel a lot, I just found the harem formation in the side stories a little boring and forced, but ok.<p>', 4.5, 1, 5, 3),
(4, 'Something lacking', '<p>One of the greatest stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It is not perfect, but is there really anything that is? (These statements are my personal opinion. Its ok to not agree). It has been a bit since I’ve read this so please forgive me if some of my statements are off. I feel like there are many good things that make this one of the best weak->strong stories currently written. The story flows amazingly and for the most part the plot never become stale or too overwhelming. He also does not become so strong that nothing is a challenge. He faces challenge all the way to the very end. The story does not become too focused on him beating something, getting stronger, beating something, etc. The story balances it out with other events with development of other characters, his relationship with others, and shows lots of world development too. You see how his actions as well as others genuinely affect the world, and he doesn''t just do whatever he wants. There is the slightest bit of romance, but it’s insignificant in my opinion. I remember thinking “What is the point of this?” It was unnecessary IMO, but on the other hand it didn’t interrupt the flow of the plot. It wasnt over the top or annoying and the girl isnt stupid. Like Ive said I’m sure there are bad things, but you can decide what those things are yourself.</p>', 3.8, 0, 4, 5),
(5, 'Average cultivation novel', '<p>MC cultivates --> Enemy approaching --> MC thinks their strong and goes to simulator to fight them --> Find out how weak they are (he doesn''t realise that he''s just strong) --> They fight --> Most of the time he kills the enemy --> Mc goes back to cultivating. This is what mostly happens in the novel after you read the early chapters. He stays in one place most of the time and doesn''t go out because he''s a coward and doesn''t realise that he''s the strongest in his area. It''s repetitive af but at the same time, it''s entertaining. You might read this review before reading the novel and say, "How is cultivating entertaining?" First of all, we get news of what''s happening to the side characters. Second, it''s just funny at how absurd his power is. Thirdly even though I said that the novel is boring, the characters are actually quite fleshed out. I feel sad when a character that we see in the norm suddenly die. It''s because they never get mentioned again and you feel like they actually died and got forgotten. The only reason I''m putting this at 3 stars is because of how addictive it is. It''s fucking boring but I promise you that you''ll waste your time reading this to like 500 chapters and drop it when you realise the problems in this novel.</p>', 2.2, 0, 5, 4);
